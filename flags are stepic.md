Congo (the) [h] 
Côte d'Ivoire [i] 
Czechia [j] 
Eswatini [k] 
Falkland Islands (the) [Malvinas] [l]
France [m]
French Southern Territories (the) [n]
Holy See (the) [o]
Korea (the Democratic People's Republic of) [p]

Taiwan (Province of China) [z]
Timor-Leste [ab]

Antarctica – [b]
Falkland Islands (the) [Malvinas] – [l]

Above is just a red herring :/ actual puzzle is in the fact that there is a flag thats not a country, which is the Upanzi Network flag. stepic is a python lib for image steganography, which is used for the flag
